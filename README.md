# Lucid-Box-7-22-2020-
The oldest game on Blender Game Engine that I have ever made - made using version 2.76
There's only source projects so it is required that you have Blender Game Engine, version 2.76 is minimum

You'll need to extract the zip file "Lucid" in the repository to access the source project files after you extract this repository that you downloaded
